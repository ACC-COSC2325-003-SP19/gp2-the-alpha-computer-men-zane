		* Basic Features - Arduino Uno SMD
                  
                  Microcontroller			ATmega328
                  
		  Operating Voltage			5V
                  
		  Input Voltage recommended power	7V-12V (Limit: 6V-20V)
                  
                  Digital I/O Pins			14 pins (6 pins with PWM output)
                  
                  Analog Input Pins			6 pins
                 
                  Flash Memory				32 KB - 0.5 KB used by bootloader
                  
                  SRAM					2 KB
                  
                  EEPROM				1 KB
                  
                  Clock Speed				16 MHz

                  Power:        Powered over USB port regulated to 5V or a 2.1mm center-positive plug coming from an AC-DC wall plug converter. Power may also be issued to the board via the power pins, connecting the leads of the power source to the GND and VIN pins, assuming the supply is within the recommended 7V - 12V range.
