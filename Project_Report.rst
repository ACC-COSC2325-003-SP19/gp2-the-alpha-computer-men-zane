                  https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUnoSMD
		* Basic Features - Arduino Uno SMD
                  
                  Microcontroller:			ATmega328
                  
		  Operating Voltage:			5V
                  
		  Input Voltage recommended power:	7V-12V (Limit: 6V-20V)
                  
                  Digital I/O Pins:			14 pins (6 pins with PWM output)
                  
                  Analog Input Pins:			6 pins
                 
                  Flash Memory:				32 KB - 0.5 KB used by bootloader
                  
                  SRAM:					2 KB
                  
                  EEPROM:				1 KB
                  
                  Clock Speed:				16 MHz

                  Power:        Powered over USB port regulated to 5V or powered over a 2.1mm center-positive plug coming from an AC-DC wall plug converter. Power may also be issued to the board via the power pins, connecting the leads of the power source to the GND and VIN pins, assuming the supply is within the recommended 7V - 12V range.
	
	
	* Controlling the device - 
		* Required input/output signals
                  s
	* Device demonstration - 
		* The code we use uses pin 13 of the arduino board and the ground next to the voltage pin. We use the wires we have to 			  line up two rows (or columns) of the component board. In the same rows we align our light and buzzer parallel. The 			  code we installed onto the arduino uses toggle and delay to give signal to make our LED to light. We also use dec and 		  brne 
	* Project Code - 
		* Any code your team authored. SOurces for other parts are fine
