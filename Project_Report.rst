		* Basic Features - Arduino Uno SMD

                  The Arduino Uno SMD board uses an ATmega328 microcontroller to run and operate this board. The Arduino Uno SMD board requires at least 5V to run and operate this board. The Arduino Uno SMD board requires an input voltage recommended power of 7V-12V (Limit: 6V-20V) to run and operate this board. The Arduino Uno SMD board should not exceed the input voltage recommended power limit when running and operating this board. There are 14 digital I/O pins (6 pins with PWM output) in the Arduino Uno SMD board. There are 6 analog input pins in the Arduino Uno SMD board. The Arduino Uno SMD board has 32 KB of flash memory to run and operate this board (0.5 KB used by the bootloader). The Arduino Uno SMD board has 2 KB of SRAM to run and operate this board. The Arduino Uno SMD board has 1 KB of EEPROM to run and operate this board. The Arduino Uno SMD board runs and operates at a clock speed of 16 MHz. The Arduino Uno SMD board is powered over a USB port regulated to 5V or powered over a 2.1mm center-positive plug coming from an AC-DC wall plug converter. Power may also be issued to the board through the power pins, connecting the leads of the power source to the GND and VIN pins, assuming that the supply is within the recommended 7V - 12V range.

	* Controlling the device - 
		* Required input/output signals
                  s
	* Device demonstration - 
		* The code we use uses pin 13 of the arduino board and the ground next to the voltage pin. We use the wires we have to 			  line up two rows (or columns) of the component board. In the same rows we align our light and buzzer parallel. The 			  code we installed onto the arduino uses toggle and delay to give signal to make our LED to light. We also use dec and 		  brne 
	* Project Code - 
		* Any code your team authored. SOurces for other parts are fine
